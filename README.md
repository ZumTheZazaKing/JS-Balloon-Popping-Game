# JS-Balloon-Popping-Game
a balloon popping game I coded using JavaScript

the original idea for this 'mildly' interesting game is from JSBeginners

Here is the page from where I got the idea:
https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-balloon-popping-project/

Although I got the idea, I didn't take a single look at the code for it as I'm a
person who prefers their own solution

anyway, the writer for the page that his code didn't get rid of the 'POP!' text after
moving the mouse away from it because he was okay with it.

But I didn't like it at all so I made my code capable of doing so

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me
